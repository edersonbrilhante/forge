# Forge Metric API Ingestion Health dashboard

This module creates the `Forge Metric API Ingestion Health` dashboard for
diagnosing metric API ingestion by Forge-owned Splunk Observability ingest
token ID. Nine token-scoped panels use an explicit, realm-validated inventory
of 61 unique `ByToken` organization metrics. Some of these internal or newer
metrics are not present in the public organization-metrics catalog but compile
in the target realm.

The dashboard separates the evidence into nine panels:

1. a focused problem overview with archived datapoints, direct drops, MTS
   creation limit calls, and CloudWatch Metric Stream drops
2. API calls and received datapoints
3. payload bytes
4. direct datapoint drops by reason
5. metric time-series creation and admission limits
6. metric type and backfill traffic
7. metadata and REST throttling
8. CloudWatch Metric Stream ingestion
9. current usage and object gauges

`token_ids` is a static allow-list and is also exposed as the restricted
`Token ID` dashboard selector. Token IDs identify senders but are not token
secrets. When the list is empty, every token-scoped chart uses a sentinel
filter so the dashboard does not show organization-wide token data.
Select one `Token ID` when investigating a sender so multi-plot charts and the
usage table remain readable.

## Interpreting drop signals

- Archived datapoints were routed to the archival tier. They are context on the
  overview's right axis, not rejected datapoints. Do not add the overview
  categories together as a deduplicated loss total; use the detailed panels to
  identify the reporting reason.
- `MTS creation limit calls` is the general token-scoped limit signal. Use the
  detailed admission panel for bad-dimension, bad-metric, property-limit, and
  MTS-throttle reason signals; do not add them to the general limited-call line.
- `Invalid` is an admission result, not a complete root cause. Correlate its
  time window with the sender response, collector logs, and an exact metric
  time-series query.
- `Timeout` is Splunk's internal post-limit signal: datapoints were not
  attempted after recent account limiting. It is not a client network timeout,
  and a token-level timeout does not prove that token caused the
  organization-wide limit.
- A successful sender or collector transport counter does not prove the metric
  time series was retained. Check direct drops and MTS admission panels before
  querying the exact metric time series.

## Adopting an existing dashboard

Applying this module without state adoption creates another dashboard and
charts. If the dashboard was first created manually, import the dashboard and
every matching existing chart into the correct downstream Terraform state
before the first apply. For the original eight-panel dashboard, import those
eight charts and let Terraform create the problem overview. If that chart was
also created manually, import it as well. Keep live object IDs in the
deployment/import procedure, not in this reusable module.
