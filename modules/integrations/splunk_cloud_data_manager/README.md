# Splunk Cloud Data Manager

This module configures Splunk Data Manager integrations for AWS log and metadata ingestion.

## Why This Module Exists

Forge sends EC2, Lambda, EKS, CloudWatch, and security metadata through supported Splunk Cloud ingestion paths. Managing Data Manager as code keeps observability reproducible instead of click-driven.

## What It Manages

- CloudFormation stacks for CloudWatch, custom CloudWatch, S3/SQS logs, and security metadata integrations.
- Generated Splunk data input modules for each integration payload.
- A metadata Lambda trigger for EC2 tag enrichment.
- Outputs containing the resulting Splunk input JSON.

## Operational Notes

- This module expects valid Splunk Cloud credentials and Data Manager configuration.
- `python3.12` must be available on the host running OpenTofu because Data Manager lifecycle operations execute locally.
- CloudFormation stack failures usually point to AWS-side permissions or region support.
- Custom log group selection determines which Forge logs arrive in Splunk Cloud.
- Configure each S3 input's IAM roles region independently from the regions containing its queues and buckets.
- Use S3 bucket-name patterns such as `forge-runner-logs-*`, or `*` when no narrower prefix is available.
- Give S3 log inputs dedicated SQS queues; competing consumers can remove notifications before Data Manager reads them.
- Group S3 inputs under the five dataset keys in `s3_logs_config`. Each enabled list item creates an independent Data Manager input and CloudFormation stack, and input names must be unique across all five lists.
- `source_type` belongs only to custom S3 log items. Predefined dataset requests omit Splunk's `sourceType` field.
- S3 input names are also stable Terraform instance keys. Reordering list items is safe, while renaming an input replaces that input's managed UUID and stack.
- To rename an input that will reuse the same queue, first disable and apply the old item, then rename, re-enable, and apply it. This prevents old and new consumers from overlapping.
- Each item's `enabled`, `name`, and `iam_region` values must be known during planning because they determine instance membership, identity, and the stack region.
